    "# Robot Navigation Kalman Filter Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook will step through a linear Kalman filter applied to raw data from a moving robot. The dataset consists of calibrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) (accelerometer, gyroscope) and geomagnetic field (magnetometer) readings from an Android phone. The data was collected by positioning a smartphone flat as a path is traversed through a building.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accelerometer measures the acceleration force along the x, y, z axes (including\n",
    "gravitational acceleration) in metres per second 2 (m/s 2 ), the gyroscope measures the rate of rotation around the x, y, z axes in radians per second (rad/s), and the magnetometer measures the geomagnetic field strength along the x, y, and z axes in microtesla (µT ). All three sensors are calibrated but tend to exhibit significant noise and bias over time, with gyroscopes in particular often displaying unbounded drift. These noisy readings need to be corrected to derive the true position and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the accuracy of indoor positioning using these sensor readings, we will be using a Kalman Filter, a recursive filter that uses state space techniques to find refined estimates for the state over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was derived from the Kaggle [Indoor Location & Navigation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/indoor-location-navigation) competition, hosted by Microsoft Research. The raw data format consists of text files that contain an inital path configuration and sensor definition. "
